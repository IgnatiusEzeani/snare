The English Lakes.
Introduction.
By the route which we have traced among the English Lakes in the following pages, we believe that the traveller may visit all the chief points of interest in the shortest space of time, while those who have their time more at command may extend their excursions to secondary points of interest by following the various diverging routes headed in italics.
We have selected Penrith as the starting point, because Ulleswater, one of the finest of the lakes, is seen to greatest advantage by being approached from this direction, while it is as convenient a quarter as any of the others from which to set out on a tour through the district.
With the carefully prepared map attached to this guide, the tourist will experience no difficulty in tracing the main route and the diverging excursions here laid down; and a very little consideration, with the aid of occasional inquiry as to minutiae when on the spot, will enable him to vary his proceedings according to inclination.
He will farther be very much aided in these investigations by observing the distinct markings on the map which include bridle-paths and carriage-roads.
In a tour of this description we believe that minute detail in regard to every possible route is unnecessary, and would only prove perplexing.
We conceive that the mere mention of all the places and objects of interest, with one good route to the most of them, and a slight indication of others, is all that is required.
This we have attempted to give in these pages, and we trust that the traveller will find the volume sufficiently explicit, while the beautiful engravings with which it is embellished will enable him in some degree to anticipate the scenery he is about to visit.
There is, perhaps, no part of Great Britain more beautiful and picturesque, more varied in its scenery, or more calculated to afford intense gratification to the tourist, - whether he travels as a man of science, as a painter, or simply as an admirer of the works of his Creator, - than the Lake District of England.
It is rich in flowers, rare plants, and luxuriant undergrowth.
Its numerous mountains present a tempting field of investigation to the geologist.
Its ruins and several very curious Roman and Druidical remains furnish points of interest to the antiquarian, while its woods and streams are associated with the names of many of our greatest poets.
Its scenery presents every variety of landscape, from the weather-beaten mountain crags and peaks, the brawling rivulets, and the wild ravines of the highlands, to the outspread lakes, the cottages, and level cultivated plains of the valleys - and in the picturesque effects of light and shade, caused by the changeful nature of its skies, the varied and happy combination of its parts, and the richness of its colouring, it is pre-eminently beautiful.
Contained within an area of not more than fifty miles in diameter, the lakes, and all the points of interest in their vicinity, may be visited in a short space of time; and owing to the comparatively small scale of the scenery, the mind of the traveller is kept constantly on the qui vive by the multitude of ever-varying and lovely objects presented in his view.
Amid the wild and magnificent scenery of the Scotch Highlands, and, much more, among the mountains and vales of Switzerland and Norway, the traveller, - albeit fulfilled with admiration at the majestic objects of nature around him, - is so completely lost in the immensity of space, and, in consequence of the magnitude of things, is frequently so long confined to one slowly shifting scene, that he entirely loses those softer feelings of placid delight which are aroused by the contemplation of equally wild and picturesque scenery on a reduced scale.
The lakes, therefore, of the mountain regions of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire, although not to be compared in magnitude or sublimity with the places before mentioned, are nevertheless possessed of charms to which the others cannot lay claim, besides having the additional advantage of being easy of access from almost any part of the kingdom.
There are many routes by which the traveller may visit the lakes.
That which we have selected as the groundwork of the present volume is one of the most central, and one by which all the principal lakes may be visited.
It is also the best, perhaps, that can be followed by pedestrians.
At all seasons the scenery of the lake district is beautiful, and will amply reward the traveller who visits it; but the best time to do so is in August and September, particularly the latter month and in October, as the autumnal foliage at this time clothes the whole country in the most gorgeous hues, while the weather is usually steady and fine.
Our starting point shall be Penrith.
Inns - George And Crown.
This is a clean-looking ancient town in the south of the county of Cumberland, lying near the junction of the Eamont and Lowther, and containing upwards of 6000 inhabitants.
There are many objects of interest in and around the town, the chief of which are, the ruins of the castle - the church-yard, in which is a curious ancient monument called the Giant's Grave; - the Beacon, from the top of which the view of some of the distant lakes is very fine and extensive; - the Giant's Caves, and a group of curious stones called Long Meg and her Daughters.
At Old Penrith are the remains of a Roman station, and the seats of the nobility and gentry in the neighbourhood are numerous.
From Penrith two roads lead to Pooley Bridge, about six miles distant, which spans the Eamont just at its issue from Ulleswater.
Either road may be taken, be we recommend that which follows the Shap road to Eamont Bridge.
Carleton Hall is near to it on the left.
Cross the bridge, and take the first road to the right.
At this point, on the left, are the druidical remains called King Arthur's Round Table, and Mayborough.
Immediately after crossing Pooley Bridge, the road runs along the western shore of Ulleswater To Patterdale, a distance of ten miles; but, before proceeding along it, the tourist would do well to take a walk of a few miles along the eastern shore, in the direction of Martindale, from several points on which he will obtain a good view of the lake.
Should this deviation be made, it will be necessary to return by the same road to Pooley Bridge, where there are two small inns, at which boats, for an excursion on the water, or for fishing, may be procured if desired.
A fine view may be had from the top of Dunmallet, on which are the vestiges of a Roman fort.
There is some good fishing here in the lake and stream.
Trout, perch, and eels, are numerous, and large lake-trout are sometimes, though seldom, taken.
Lowther Castle, the seat of the Earl of Lonsdale, is distant from this bridge about four miles.
Ulleswater is nine miles in length, by nearly a mile wide, at the broadest point; but, owing to its irregular form, it is divided into three reaches, the first of which is closed in by Hallen Fell, on the western shore.
The second is terminated by Stybarrow Crag on the east, with Helvellyn towering in the distance behind it, and Birk Fell on the west.
The third reach is decidedly the most beautiful, being surrounded by towering mountains, and studded with little islands, which, combined with the woods and rich vegetation, present a magnificent scene.
The view in our engraving is taken from Birk Fell, having Stybarrow Crag on the right.
After leaving Pooley Bridge, the scenery, for the first three or four miles, is comparatively tame; but after passing the village of Watermillock, it improves rapidly.
About a mile beyond Halsteads, the road enters Gowbarrow Park, formerly the hunting seat of the Duke of Norfolk, now the property of Mr. Howards of Greystoke.
It is of great size, and is filled with beautiful groups of trees, among which may be seen herds of fallow-deer, whose presence give the additional charm of wilderness to the scene.
Lyulph's Tower, which stands on an eminence here, is a picturesque object; and there are many exquisite" bits" of minute scenery, clad with luxuriant verdure, that will delight the eye of a painter.
From Lyulph's Tower, a delightful walk runs up a rocky vale to a waterfall called Aira Force.
Force is the general name for a waterfall.
This is a beautiful fall.
It leaps from the top of a wooded cliff, through a narrow gorge, and descends a sheer perpendicular height of eighty feet.
The roar of the falling waters, and the descending of spray, add to the feelings of romance created by the view of rugged rocks, thickly planted trees, and hanging verdure, which characterize the spot.
